## Trading Bot Project
## What is this repository
# This is a personal project I am working on to create a trading algorithm using the TDAmeritrade API that will trade stocks based on the use of certain indicators and charts
# This project was written in python and uses tda-api to interact with the TD Ameritrade developer site 
# Paper trading using QuantConnect to backtest trading performance of stocks

From this Project I Will Learn
- How to use TDA API and API's in general
- How to trade using algorithms
- How to convert a trading strategy into code that can be processed 
- Continued practice with github

## Trading Bot Project
## What is this repository
This is a personal project I am working on to create a trading algorithm using the TDAmeritrade API that will trade stocks based on the use of certain indicators and charts.
This project was written in python and uses tda-api to interact with the TD Ameritrade developer site. 
Paper trading using QuantConnect to backtest trading performance of stocks.
# My Strategy
My strategy is still in progress of being implimented into the trading bot. Ultimately, I will test out trading of leveraged and unleveraged market etfs based on the movement of the NYAD, which tracks the advance and decline of the NYSE and is a good indicator of upward movement of the market in the coming hours. This trading strategy takes advantage of the minor fractals in the markets movement and trades are meant to be executed in a day trading or swing trading method. Further investigation is needed to determine the time frame to maximize profits. Other charts will also be implimented if possible icluding: ADVDEC.NQ, ADRQ, though I will try to determine if only the NYAD is needed. 

#From this Project I Will Learn
- How to use TDA API and API's in general
- How to trade using algorithms
- How to convert a trading strategy into code that can be processed 
- Continued practice with Github 
- Use of various packages to interact with Google chrome and TD Ameritrade platform
